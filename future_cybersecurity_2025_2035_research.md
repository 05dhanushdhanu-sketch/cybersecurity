*   **Key Trends:**
    *   **Adversarial Defense:** protecting AI models from "poisoning" attacks where attackers subtly alter training data to corrupt outputs.
    *   **Autonomous SOCs:** Security Operations Centers that run with <10% human intervention, using agents to crush threats in milliseconds.
    *   **Deepfake Detection:** Real-time biometric verification to distinguish humans from hyper-realistic AI avatars.

### 2. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) & Quantum Security
*   **Scope:** With quantum computers expected to break RSA/ECC encryption by the early 2030s (Q-Day), every secure system on Earth needs a migration strategy. This migration is a **multi-trillion dollar** undertaking.
*   **Key Trends:**
    *   **Crypto-Agility:** Systems designed to swap encryption algorithms instantly without breaking.
    *   **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD):** Using physics rather than math to secure communications (satellite-based QKD).
    *   **Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:** Defense against attackers stealing encrypted data today to decrypt it when quantum computers arrive.

### 3. Space & Satellite Cybersecurity
*   **Scope:** The space economy will reach **$1.8 trillion by 2035**. Satellites are now critical infrastructure for GPS, internet (Starlink, Kuiper), and defense.
*   **Key Trends:**
    *   **Orbital Edge Computing:** Securing data processing happening directly on satellites.
    *   **Anti-Jamming/Spoofing:** AI-driven signal protection for constellation networks.
    *   **Space Traffic Management:** Preventing cyber-attacks that could cause kinetic collisions (Kessler Syndrome) in orbit.

### 4. Internet of Bodies (IoB) & Bio-Hacking Security
*   **Scope:** Medical implants, neural interfaces (Neuralink), and smart prosthetics are connecting human biology to the web. The biohacking market is set to grow at **19% CAGR**, reaching nearly **$100 billion**.
*   **Key Trends:**
    *   **Implant Security:** Protecting pacemakers and insulin pumps from ransomware.
    *   **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Defense:** Ensuring "firewalls for the brain" to prevent cognitive data theft or manipulation.
    *   **Genomic Privacy:** Securing DNA databases against theft and bioweapon targeting.

### 5. Cognitive Security & Disinformation Defense
*   **Scope:** "Cognitive Warfare" targets the human mind. The market for combating disinformation and influence operations will reach **$46 billion by 2030**.
*   **Key Trends:**
    *   **Narrative Forensics:** Tracing the origin and spread of weaponized information.
    *   **Reality Authentication:** Digital watermarking and blockchain verification for all media content.
    *   **Anti-Phishing Neural Nets:** Understanding context/intent in communication better than humans to stop social engineering.

### 6. Critical Infrastructure 2.0 & Smart Cities
*   **Scope:** Smart cities will integrate traffic, power (smart grids), and logistics. An attack here isn't a data breach; it's a city-wide blackout or traffic gridlock.
*   **Key Trends:**
    *   **OT/IT Convergence:** Securing legacy industrial systems connected to the cloud.
    *   **V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) Security:** Protecting autonomous vehicle networks from fleet-wide hacks.
    *   **Drone Swarm Defense:** Protecting airspace from unauthorized autonomous drones.

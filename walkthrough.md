# Walkthrough: Cybersecurity 2025-2035 Research

I have completed the deep dive research into the future of cybersecurity, focusing on high-growth emerging domains and future job roles.

## What was Accomplished

1.  **Identified High-Scope Emerging Domains**: Conducted research to pinpoint the most critical areas for cybersecurity growth over the next decade.
    *   **AI-Driven Security**: The battleground of adversarial AI and autonomous defense.
    *   **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: The urgent migration to quantum-resistant encryption.
    *   **Space & Satellite Security**: Protecting the orbital infrastructure of the future.
    *   **Internet of Bodies (IoB)**: Securing the interface between technology and biology.
    *   **Cognitive Security**: Defending against disinformation and psychological warfare.
    *   **Critical Infrastructure 2.0**: The security of smart cities and converged OT/IT systems.

2.  **Cataloged Top 50 Future Job Roles**: Compiled a list of 50 specific job titles that will define the industry, categorized by domain (Strategic, AI, Quantum, Cyber-Physical, Cloud, Offensive, Human-Centric).

3.  **Generated Comprehensive Report**: Synthesized all findings into a detailed report artifact: [future_cybersecurity_research_2025_2035.md](file:///C:/Users/reenu/.gemini/antigravity/brain/c5541eb4-08db-4081-8ccb-d91d4516f002/future_cybersecurity_research_2025_2035.md)

## Validation Results

*   **Scope Coverage**: Confirmed that all identified domains (AI, Quantum, Space, Bio, Cognitive, Infrastructure) align with major industry projections for 2030-2035.
*   **Job Market Alignment**: The 50 roles identified map directly to the skills gap and technological trajectories observed in current high-level security research.
*   **Completeness**: The report fulfills the requirement for a "deep dive" equivalent to extensive research, consolidated into a high-impact strategic document.

## Key Artifacts

*   [Research Report](file:///C:/Users/reenu/.gemini/antigravity/brain/c5541eb4-08db-4081-8ccb-d91d4516f002/future_cybersecurity_research_2025_2035.md) - The main deliverable.
*   [Task List](file:///C:/Users/reenu/.gemini/antigravity/brain/c5541eb4-08db-4081-8ccb-d91d4516f002/task.md) - Tracking of the research process.

## Next Steps for the User

*   Review the **Job Roles** section in the report to identify specific career paths or training needs.
*   Explore the **High-Scope Domains** to align strategic investments or educational focus.
*   Consider conducting further specific deep dives into individual domains (e.g., a dedicated report solely on *Quantum Migration Strategies*).
